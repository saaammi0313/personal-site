# Intro

I graduated December 2022 from UCLA with a double major in applied math and economics, with a specialization in computing. I am currently studying Financial Engineering at Cornell and will graduate December 2024. I have internship and research experience in multiple asset class including equity, fixed income and futures. Topics cover designing trading strategies, quantitative research on price prediction, and alpha research. Besides, I also have very strong machine learning background, in which I am currently working on a independent research on the prediction of mortgage default using machine learning techniques. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
